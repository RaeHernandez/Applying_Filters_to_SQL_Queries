# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I used SQL filters to investigate potential security issues in an organization’s systems. My role involved analyzing login attempts and employee machine data to identify unusual activity and ensure proper system updates. By applying operators such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and the `LIKE` wildcard, I was able to retrieve targeted information from different tables and refine data for investigation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Investigate failed login attempts after business hours
- Identify suspicious login activity on specific dates
- Filter login attempts originating outside of Mexico
- Extract information on employee machines in specific departments or buildings
- Demonstrate effective use of SQL filters and pattern matching for security-focused data analysis

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Writing SQL queries with filters
- Using `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators
- Using the `LIKE` operator and `%` wildcard for pattern matching
- Analyzing login attempts and employee data for security investigations
- Documenting queries and results for a portfolio

## Project Workflow
1. Retrieved after-hours failed login attempts
2. Investigated login attempts on specific dates
3. Filtered login attempts outside of Mexico
4. Retrieved employee information in Marketing (East building)
5. Retrieved employee information in Finance or Sales departments
6. Retrieved all employees not in IT

## Included PDF
The PDF **Apply filters to SQL queries** is included in this repository. It documents the step-by-step SQL queries used in this project and contains:
- Screenshots of queries and query outputs
- Explanations of how each query works
- Examples of filtering with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE`
- Notes on how the queries support security investigations

## Summary
This project highlights how SQL filters can be applied to extract targeted information from multiple tables for security analysis. Using structured queries and pattern matching, I was able to refine results to support specific investigative and operational needs, demonstrating both technical proficiency and attention to security protocols.
